#ATM Mockup
Something I want to fix is the submit butotn is disabled in some instances but if users hit enter you can still get around the validation and the form is submitted. 
looked it up and if I changed it from a submit to a button type with a handlechange as my onsubmit function it should fix the problem but rn feeling a bit lazy so if I need to come back to this ill improve it then
